# AdaptNet-MICCAI2021
This repository provides the official PyTorch implementation of AdaptNet (Shape/Scale Adaptive U-Net).

AdaptNet is initially proposed for semantic segmentation in cataract surgery videos, but can be adopted for any medical or general purpose image segmentation problem.

This neural network architecture is especially designed to deal with severe deformations and scale variations by fusing sequential and parallel feature maps adaptively.
